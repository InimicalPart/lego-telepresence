# LTP - Lego Telepresence

## To-Do / Ideas / I Want To-Dos
- [ ] Try to fix the 3s delay between the GoPro and website
  - [ ] Find alternatives for sending live feed from GoPro to server
    - [Preview mode](https://community.gopro.com/s/article/GoPro-Quik-Live-Preview?language=en_US)?
      - Requires PI to connect to GoPro's WiFi, PI has 1 network adapter
        - Get a small another network adapter? 
      - Can work via USB?
        - Connect camera to RPI's micro USB port
            - Requires USB-C to Micro USB adapter
  - [Webcam mode](https://community.gopro.com/s/article/GoPro-Webcam?language=en_US)?
    - Is Linux supported?
  - Use phone instead?
    - Inefficient
    - Phone is big
    - Not enough LEGO pieces for an adjustable phone mount
    - How?
- [ ] Real-time available cars updating on /
- [ ] Real-time car availability updating on /[UUID]/control
- [ ] Implement instructional movement
- [ ] Record movements, with playback / saving
- [ ] Make movement UI a bit more prettier and user-friendly
- [ ] Add more control buttons
  - [ ] Turn off camera stream? (permanent)
- [ ] "Unprepare" car when the user leaves the control site
- [ ] Do not allow multi-control (someone else controlling is another person is controlling)
  - [ ] Allow viewing and sound
- [ ] Car Client - Fix bugs
  - [ ] Not very stable, may crash if wrongly configured, or get stuck in certain situations
  - [ ] Reconnect function gets called multiple times, even if already connected to the car which glitches things out
  - [ ] Automatically calibrate the wheels to be straight (possible?)
  - [ ] If car disconnects, the software will not try to reconnect, which it should try to do forever
- [ ] WiFiWeb
  - [ ] Add functionality to add a connection from saved files?
    - [ ] *.nmconnection?
    - [ ] Configuration dump of ``nmcli -t -c no c show <name>``?
    - [ ] My own?
  - [ ] Add functionality to add a connection based on the Wi-Fis around the server
  - [x] For even more security, set a random user and password for the API endpoint of length 32
